    Laser cutting is a non-contact process which utilizes a laser to cut materials, resulting in high quality, dimensionally accurate cuts. The process works by directing the laser beam through a jet to the workpiece. In the machine there are many particles that trought the eletricity they start to move and to create waves, this last ones are reflected by a mirror on the side of the machine that in turn it is reflected by an 45ยบ mirrors put it in the courser and created the light that we see and commonly called laser (but it's wrong). This combination of heat and pressure creates the cutting action. It is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists.

    <li>STEP 1</li>
    Create your artwork. Its colour define the power, velocity and.. of the laser cut
    <li>STEP 2</li>
    Be sure that fan's tube is connected to the machine (it will be working when you turn on the machine)
    <li>STEP 3</li>
    Turn on the laser cut, and wait till the machine understand their size
    <li>STEP 4</li>
    Control that the removilble table (where stay materials) is fixed well (if it isn't, raise it and take off the material under)
    <li>STEP 5</li>
    Put the material in the machine and use the focus tool to set the z of the laser cut, it's necessary to turn down the removible table and turn up it slowly till the focus tool doesn't fall down (now it knows how high is the z of the material) 
    <li>STEP 6</li>
    Connect the laser cut at the PC. Select print and the working area (in the artwork softwere) and in the print windows put that it will be: vector, scale 1:1, proprieties(working area, material...), indicate what the color means in sense of velocity, power...

    Tips: if the cut isn't clean or the same, maybe the 45ยบ mirror is dirty (DONT FORCE THE MACHINE, IT CAN BURN)
