  3D Printing is a processes used to create three-dimensional objects, where layers by layers of material formed  an object under the computer control. 
  <br>Objects can be downdloaded or created by a 3d softwere and have to be saved in .STL (STereoLithography) or .3dm.
   Once you have the file open it with Cura, or another similar softwere, where you have to select the machine that you'll use and the material. Then check all the values, in particular you have to controll that 
   <ul style="font-family:courier">
   <li>the layer's height are in crescents values;</li>
   <li>if the wall thickness is what you want</li>
   <li>the infill density is in the right percentual</li>
   <li>the temperature (generaly for PVL the printing 
    temperature is 210/250ยบ and the buil plate temperature is almost 45ยบ</li> 
   <li>check if the object need support</li>
   <li>create a brim (initial layers at the bottom to create a tipe of support for all the object)</li>
  </ul>
   <p  style="font-family:courier">and then save it. (For some machine, especially in the Multimakers, you have to put the file in the memory card).
  <br>After you have to prepare the machine:
  <ul style="font-family:courier">
  <li>go to prepare -> setup -> preheat (in this fase you put out some material to be sure that is melted)</li>
<li>prepare -> Auto home or set the z (if the z is not at the right high you can go to Prepare -> disable steppers and regulate manually the z asset</li>
<li>after you have to put the hair spray on the surface of the glass</li>
    <li>then you have to stuck it on the base with some pins</li> <li> now select the file on the machine and wait until it's done. </li>
    </ul>
