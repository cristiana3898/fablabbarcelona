    An electronic circuit is composed of individual electronic components, such as resistors, transistors, capacitors, inductors and diodes, connected by conductive wires or traces through which electric current can flow.
    <br>We can suppose that electricity is a "river" where the water is the amper and the density is the resistence.
    <br>An eletronic circuit need power+output+connections[that can be any trasmitting material(the Doh, pongo, is a tramitter and also a resistor)]
  <br> For understanding Adruino and all the electronic circiut we have to think that they are like humans:
  <ul>
    <li>brain = hardwere</li>
    <li>neurons = softwere</li>
    <li>eyes = cameras</li>
    <li>arms = motors</li>
    <li>hands = sensors</li>
