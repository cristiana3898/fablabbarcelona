	<h1>The vinyl cutter</h1>
	</header>
The vinyl cutter is, as the name, is a type of computer-controlled machine (small vinyl cutters look like computer printers) where the computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl). The vinyl can be stuck onto almost any surface.
<p>
	The machine works with vector image and it cuts along the vector paths laid out in the design. The cutter is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over the material, cutting it into any shape imaginable.
