<h2>How to create a website</h2>
<p style="color:black"><p style="font-size:20px;">
<li>First of all we created a Trello account that is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. Then we created a GitHub account and downloaded it for the desktop. This app is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
On Github we created a new repository that we can all join. Then we stated working on this file with Sublime text, that is a proprietary cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and functions can be added by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.Then with HTML tutorials we staretd create the webpage.</li>
