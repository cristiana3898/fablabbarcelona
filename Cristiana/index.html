<h2>How to create a website</h2>
<p style="color:black"><p style="font-size:20px;">
<li>First of all we created a Trello account that is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. Then we created a GitHub account and downloaded it for the desktop. This app is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
On Github we created a new repository that we can all join. Then we stated working on this file with Sublime text, that is a proprietary cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and functions can be added by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.Then with HTML tutorials we staretd create the webpage.</li>

<h2>Bio Plastic fabric</h2>
<p style="color:black"><p style="font-size:20px;">
<li>To create a Bio plastic fabric to produce an apron you have to take the recipe and the ingredients and some containers.</li>
<li>The ingredients:</li>
<li>-250ml of water,</li>
<li>-50g of gelatine,</li>
<li>-20g of glicerina vegetal.</li>
<li>-Acrylic paint </li>
 We put the water in the pot on the electric cooker, then we started add the gelatine while mixing it, we have to be careful to don't let form lumps in the liquid. We let it boil and then we put the glicerina. Then the gelatine started create a white foam that we remove with a spoon. Then we add the acrylic paint and mix it all over gain. After taking away the foam we inverted the liquid on a table and let it dry for some days.</p>

<li>+Then click on window, when it opens, on the top click move and move the area on 0.0,</li>
<li>+Click on print,
<li>*Tropec:</li>

<li>+Check the knife,</li>
<li>*Properties cutting select the voice -get from the machine-</li>
<li>-If you want simplify a photo goes to path on inkscape and click on simplify</li>

<h2> 3D Printer </h2>
<li>3D Printing, also known as Additive Manufacturing, refers to processes used to create a three-dimensional object  in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object. Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and typically are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file. STereoLithography (STL) is one of the most common file types that 3D printers can read. Once you have to file, you must open it with Cura. On it you have to select the material and the machine that you'll use. Then you have to check all the values and save it. (For the Multimaker, you have to put the file in the memory card).
To prepare the machine you have to put the hair spray on the surface of the glass top, the you have to stuck it on the base with some pins. Then select print on the machine and it'll pepare the material. Then wait until it's done!
Below there're the values of our object.</li>

<h2>Arduino</h2>
<li>Arduino is an open source computer hardware. It is composed by electronics boards that it has a microcontroller. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits.

<h2> Milling Machine </h2>
<li> Milling is the machining process of using rotary cutters to remove material from a workpiece by advancing in a direction at an angle with the axis of the tool. With this technology you can create your own circuit.
First step you have to open your PNG file on Fab Modules that is an open Source CAM software. It allows you to generate machining strategies for lots of different processes and machines.
Once you have finished setting up the cutting strategy you should save th file (pay attention to the z0 and the zHome, it have to be at leat 5 or you'll cut when it returns to the home). It'll download into your computer as a .rml file.
Then you have to open the file with Roland Monofab that is a desktop milling machine. It moves in much the same way as a 3d printer, but instead of adding material it substracts it. The CAM software that controls the machine is called V panel. 
First of all we'll need to secure the Blnck PCB to the bed of the monofab with double sided tape. Then by moving the Milling bit at the bottom left corner of the blank we can Zero the X and Y axis using the User oordinate system.</li>g
