<h2>Day 1: How to create a website</h2>
<p style="color:black"><p style="font-size:20px;">First of all we created a Trello account that is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. Then we created a GitHub account and downloaded it for the desktop. This app is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
On Github we created a new repository that we can all join. Then we stated working on this file with Sublime text, that is a proprietary cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and functions can be added by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.Then with HTML tutorials we staretd create the webpage.</p>  
<h2>Day 2: Weekly tasks</h2>
<p style="color:black"><p style="font-size:20px;"> Today we defined our tasks for the week. We have to test a workshop for some guys between 10 to 14 years. But before we created a Bio plastic fabric to produce an apron. First of all we take the recipe and the ingredients: 250ml of water, 50g of gelatine and 20g of glicerina vegetal. We put the water in the pot on the stove, then we started add the gelatine while mixing it, we have to be careful to don't let form lumps in the liquid. We let it boil and then we put the glicerina. Then the gelatine started create a white foam that we remove with a spoon. Then we add the acrylic paint and mix it all over gain. After taking away the foam we inverted the liquid on a table and let it dry.</nav>
