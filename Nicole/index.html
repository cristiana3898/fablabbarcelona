    <h1>Websites</h1>
    <p>Today we created an account on <a href= https://trello.com/>Trello </a>. This application organizes the project that you do into boards. Trello need to see what you have to do, what you're doing and done. Then we also created an account on <a href= https://github.com/> Github </a> . There we did a shered repository to do a project together, a Website. This has permit to us to share our changes. So we started to create our website through Sublime Text. It's a property cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface.</p>

    <h1>Bioplastic Textile</h1>
    <p>In this second day we helped a member of the FabLab to create an apron in bioplastic textile. First of all we took a base and we created the wood's edges to not drop the liquid. Then we prepared the ingredients and the tools that we used.</P> 
    <p> <img src="file:///C:/Users/niky_/Documents/GitHub/fablabbarcelona/Nicole/foto%20sitoweb/IMG_5016.JPG" alt="Base" width="350" height="370"> </p>  
      <p> Ingredients:
    <ul>
      <li>Acrylic paint;</li>
      <li>Glycerin vegetal;</li>
      <li>Gelatine;</li>
      <li>Water.</li> 
    </ul>
    <ul>
    Tools: 
      <li>Balance;</li>
      <li>Borner;</li>
      <li>Pot</li>
      <li>Containers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> <img src="file:///C:/Users/niky_/Documents/GitHub/fablabbarcelona/Nicole/foto%20sitoweb/IMG_5012.JPG" alt="ingredients" widht="250" height="270"></p>

     <p>We put the pot on the borner and then we mixed water and gelatine. If you want a clean work, you have to pay attention that the liquid doesn't have lumps. Sometimes, after a few minutes, it can form a white resin that it have to be removed if you don't want a pattern. After we mixed the liquid with the acrylic paint and then we overthrown the liquid on the base that we created. </p>

    <h1>Laser Cutter, Trotec</h1>
    <p>Laser cutter is a technology that permits to cut materials, and it is used for industrial manufacturing application, and also for school, business and hobbyists. Today a member of the FabLab explained to us how to use the laser cutter. First of all you need to check that the 2 tube are connected with the machine. Then you have to control that the removable table is hooked well. At this point you can switch on the machine. After you have to find the exaclty point of the table, for doing this you can move to right and left the table through the keys and also to up and down. For the lasest passage, you can use the focus tool. The focus tool serves to understand to machine the thickness of the material that you use. Then, through the computer, you have to decide the working area. At the end you have to send the file.</p>
    <p>Process:
    	<ul>
    		<li>Check the aspirations tube and the cable;</li>
    		<li>Turn on the machine;</li>
    		<li>Focusing using the tool;</li>
     		<li>Download the 3dm file from the cloud;</li>
			<li>Open the file with Rhino;</li>
			<li>On Rhino, check if the design have break lines, if it has, you hAve to select all the design and join it (clicking on join);</li>
			<li>On Rhino, check the measures and put all the design in red;</li>
			<li>Click on file and then on print;</li>
			<li>Check id the machine is the right one, then check the scale that have to be 1:1, then check if the imagine is in vectors:</li>
			<li>Click on properties and select the working area;</li>
			<li>Then click on window, when it opens, on the top click move and move the area on 0.0;</li>
			<li>Click on print;</li>
			<li>Open Tropec;</li>
			<li>Drag the design from the left to the middle;</li>
			<li>Click on ready to connect the machine to the pc;</li>
			<li>Click on setting and then on materials (first voice);</li>
			<li>Select your material, speed and power (you have to take some tests to find the right one.</li>
		</ul></p>

<h1>Vinyl Cutter</h1>
<ul>
<li>Open the file in inkscape:</li>
<li>If there're some imperfections scale it very big,</li>
<li>Then press Ctrl + C and paste it on Cutstudio with Ctrl V,</li>
<li>On properties select the measurements,</li>
<li>On the machine:</li>
<li>Put the vinyl,</li>
<li>Check the rolls (they have to be on the white spots),</li>
<li>Select the type of the vinyl (roll or piece)</li>
<li>Check the knife,</li>
<li>Properties cutting select the voice -get from the machine-</li>
<li>If you want simplify a photo goes to path on inkscape and click on simplify</li>

		<h1>Arduino</h1>
		<p>Arduino is an open source computer hardware. It is composed by electronics boards that it has a microcontroller. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs from personal computers. The Arduino project started in 2003 as a program for students at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in Ivrea, Italy, aiming to provide a low-cost and easy way for novices and professionals to create devices that interact with their environment using sensors and actuators. Common examples of such devices intended for beginner hobbyists include simple robots, thermostats, and motion detectors.</p>
	    <p>Arduino Code:
	    	<ul>
	    <li>Variable</li>
	    <li>Loops</li>
	    <li>Conditional</li>
	    <li>Functions</li>
	    <li>Int, for example: 1,2,3...</li>
	    <li>Char, for example: A,B,C...</li>
	    <li>String, a word</li>
	    <li>Float, for example: 1.45</li>
	    <li>Boolean</li>
	    <li>Type</li>

		<h1>3D printer</h1>
		<p>3D Printing, also known as Additive Manufacturing, refers to processes used to create a three-dimensional object in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object. Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and typically are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file. STereoLithography (STL) is one of the most common file types that 3D printers can read. Once you have to file, you must open it with Cura. On it you have to select the material and the machine that you'll use. Then you have to check all the values and save it. (For the Multimaker, you have to put the file in the memory card). To prepare the machine you have to put the hair spray on the surface of the glass top, the you have to stuck it on the base with some pins. Then select print on the machine and it'll pepare the material. Then wait until it's done! Below there're the values of our object.</p>

		<h1>Milling Machine</h1>
		<p>Thanks by this machine you can create a cicuite. Milling is the machining process of using rotary cutters to remove material from a workpiece by advancing in a direction at an angle with the axis of the tool. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points. As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter. First step you have to open your PNG file on Fab Modules that is an open Source CAM software. It allows you to generate machining strategies for lots of different processes and machines. Once you have finished setting up the cutting strategy you should save th file (pay attention to the z0 and the zHome, it have to be at leat 5 or you'll cut when it returns to the home). It'll download into your computer as a .rml file. Then you have to open the file with Roland Monofab that is a desktop milling machine. It moves in much the same way as a 3d printer, but instead of adding material it substracts it. The CAM software that controls the machine is called V panel. First of all we'll need to secure the Blnck PCB to the bed of the monofab with double sided tape. Then by moving the Milling bit at the bottom left corner of the blank we can Zero the X and Y axis using the User oordinate system.</p>
