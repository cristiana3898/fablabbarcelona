  <p>
    The Bioplastic is an articial fabric made by natural materials like: 
    <ul>
      <li>Glycerin (20 g)</li>
      <li>Gelatin  (50 g)</li>
      <li>Water (250 ml)</li>
      <li>almost any kind of painting (as required)</li>
    </ul>
    (the recipe can be multiplied as many times we need)</p>
   <p> This textile can be creat at home with tools like:
    <ul>
      <li>Bilance</li>
    <li>Burner</li>
    <li>Pot</li>
    <li>Containers</li>
    </ul>
    It is very simple to do. 
  </p>
  <p>
    First of all we have to put the water in the pot and turn on the burner, immediatly after we have to pour the gelatin in the water very slowly to prevent clumps and blend it some minutes, then we can add the glycerin. 
  </p>
  <p>
    After this step we can see apper, in the upper part, a kind of white glaze that can be removed or keeped (if you want to have a pattern you can keep it because this foam can change and create a shade of the colour), then we can add colours if we want.</p>
    <p>When the recipe is done we have only to put it on a plain surface and let it chill (remeber: the bioplastic is liquid so it need to have a frame to stop its expantion)</p>
