<h2>Day 1: How to create a website</h2>
<p style="color:black"><p style="font-size:20px;">First of all we created a Trello account that is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. when you can know what to do and what is done.
Then we created a GitHub account and downloaded it for the desktop. This app is like a Google drive, but better becouse you can modify the file whenever you want. </p>
