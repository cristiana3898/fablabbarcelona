    <h1>Websites</h1>
    <p>Today we created an account on <a href= https://trello.com/>Trello </a>. This application organizes the project that you do into boards. Trello need to see what you have to do, what you're doing and done. Then we also created an account on <a href= https://github.com/> Github </a> . There we did a shered repository to do a project together, a Website. This has permit to us to share our changes. So we started to create our website through Sublime Text. It's a property cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface.</p>

    <h1>Bioplastic Textile</h1>
    <p>In this second day we helped a member of the FabLab to create an apron in bioplastic textile. First of all we took a base and we created the wood's edges to not drop the liquid. Then we prepared the ingredients and the tools that we used.</P> 
      <p> Ingredients:
    <ul>
      <li>Acrylic paint;</li>
      <li>Glycerin vegetal;</li>
      <li>Gelatine;</li>
      <li>Water.</li> 
    </ul>
    <ul>
    Tools: 
      <li>Balance;</li>
      <li>Borner;</li>
      <li>Pot</li>
      <li>Containers.</li>
    </ul>
     We put the pot on the borner and then we mixed water and gelatine. If you want a clean work, you have to pay attention that the liquid doesn't have lumps. Sometimes, after a few minutes, it can form a white resin that it have to be removed if you don't want a pattern. After we mixed the liquid with the acrylic paint and then we overthrown the liquid on the base that we created. </p>
